        <p id="intro">Back in 2012, my friend Natalie and I took a trip to Spain. We spent nearly two weeks exploring 3 wonderful cities - Madrid, Valencia, and Barcelona.</p>

      <h2>Madrid</h2>
        <p>Our flight landed early in the morning on our first day in Madrid. That afternoon we took a sightseeing bus tour showing us some of the highlights of the city. After that bus tour we attended a bullfight, which was brutal and not something I am ever interested in experiencing again.</p>
        <p>One of my favorite things that we did in Madrid was visit the Prado Museum. We saw many incredible works of art by renowned artists such as Rembrandt, Goya, Raphael, and Picasso. </p>

      <h2 id="valencia">Valencia & Buñol</h2>

        <p>After a few days in Madrid, we took a train down to Valencia on the southeastern coast. We spent an evening in Valencia and enjoyed the regional dish Paella Valenciana, but the main reason we travelled to Valencia was to participate in La Tomatina.</p>
        <p>Held on the last Wednesday of August each year for over 70 years, La Tomatina is a festival in which thousands of people throw tomatoes at each other in the streets. La Tomatina takes place in the small village of Buñol just outside Valencia. It was an incredibly fun experience, even if I couldn’t bring myself to eat tomatoes for a few weeks afterwards.</p>

      <h2>Barcelona</h2>

        <p>Our final destination was the Catalonian city of Barcelona. Right on the coast, Barcelona is a stunningly beautiful city with world-renowned architecture.</p>
        <p>We saw the spectular unfinished cathedral of La Sagrada Familia, designed by famed Catalan architect Antoni Gaudi. The photo below was taken from the top of the cathedral, showing the view of Barcelona from above.</p>
